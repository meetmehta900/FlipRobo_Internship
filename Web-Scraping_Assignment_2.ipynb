It's pleasure to use iOS and the quality product by Apple. Iphone 11 still works like a beast in 2021 also. It really capable of doing day to day usage as well as hard core gaming. Battery is awesome. I'm really too much satisfied with it. Apart fto the very gorgious IPS LCD (AMOLED will be better) everything is mind boggling. Iphone💕.  \n",

Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black  \n",

Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.  \n",

       "50  I upgraded (downgraded?) from my iPhone X since the phone fell down and I didn't want to repair the screen. The box that the phone came in was super slim and I was worried that there'd be no 5W charger with it and my fears were confirmed. However, thankfully I had the 18W USB-C PD charger from Apple which I bought for my iPhone X and it worked perfectly.
